          Today is the third day of my 28-day React Native with Expo learning plan.
          My objective was to understand the default project structure created by Expo
          and to learn about the most commonly used core components in React Native.
          I planned to create a basic user interface to practice using these components.

          Today is Day 4 of my 28-day learning journey in React Native with Expo (TypeScript).The focus for today was to
          understand how to style components properly and use Flexboxfor layouts. Styling is very important in mobile

          I now have a strong understanding of how styling and layout works in React Native using Flexbox, even with

          I was able to build and align multiple components in both rows and columns, and the structure looked neat.
          Styling felt very similar to CSS, but the layout with Flexbox was powerful and responsive.

          Today is Day 5 of my 28-day React Native with Expo (TypeScript) course. My main goal was to learn how to
          create input fields using <code>TextInput</code> and handle user interactions with <code>Button</code>. I

          The <code>Button</code> component worked well for triggering actions, and seeing the input displayed on the

          State allows components to manage their own data and re-render when it changes, while props enable passing

          safer.

          At the end of the day, I felt comfortable using both <code>ScrollView</code> and
          <code>FlatList</code> to display content. <code>ScrollView</code> is simple and good
          for smaller lists, but <code>FlatList</code> is much better for handling many items
          efficiently. Defining TypeScript interfaces for the data made the code more organized
          and easier to understand.

          Today is Day 25 of my 28-day React Native with Expo learning journey using TypeScript.
          My main goal was to understand how to get my app ready for deployment to app stores.
          I planned to learn about optimizing the build, configuring app details, and preparing
          the assets needed for publishing.
